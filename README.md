# What is this?

![The definition of "boilerplate"](https://i.imgur.com/0xEmAP6.png)

This is a template repository used to simplify the above, as setting this up for every project adds up overtime.

The project specifically targets the creation of "offline websites" that, similar to your first web developer experience, enables and streamlines the creation of HTML that is intended to be ran offline on a local device, i.e. by double-clicking on the HTML file and having it run as you would expect it to. This is able to be achieved through the sole use of Vite.

## What does it support?

At the moment, only React is supported. PRs are welcome, though you are just as welcome to make your own forks to support other front-end frameworks.

## Licensing
